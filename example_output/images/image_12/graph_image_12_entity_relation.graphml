  <data key="d1">"The image is a table titled 'The effect of hyperparameters in Tversky Index.' It shows the impact of the hyperparameter \\( \\alpha \\) on performance metrics for two datasets: 'Chinese Onto4.0' and 'English QuoRef.' The table is structured with three columns: the first column lists the values of \\( \\alpha \\) ranging from 0.1 to 0.9, the second column presents the corresponding performance scores for the 'Chinese Onto4.0' dataset, and the third column shows the performance scores for the 'English QuoRef' dataset. The performance scores are represented as numerical values, likely indicating F1 scores or similar metrics. Key observations include: \n- For the 'Chinese Onto4.0' dataset, the highest performance score is 84.67, achieved when \\( \\alpha = 0.6 \\). \n- For the 'English QuoRef' dataset, the highest performance score is 68.44, achieved when \\( \\alpha = 0.4 \\). \n- The performance scores for both datasets fluctuate as \\( \\alpha \\) changes, indicating that the hyperparameter \\( \\alpha \\) plays a significant role in tuning the model's performance. \n- The table highlights the variability in performance across different values of \\( \\alpha \\), suggesting that optimal hyperparameter settings may differ between datasets. \n- The context provided in the caption indicates that \\( \\beta \\) is set as \\( 1 - \\alpha \\), and the focus is on the effect of \\( \\alpha \\) alone. The table is part of an experimental analysis to evaluate the impact of hyperparameters on the Tversky Index in a computational linguistics or machine learning context."</data>
