  <data key="d1">**Summary for IMAGE_11:**  

IMAGE_11 is a table labeled *"Table 8: The effect of different data augmentation ways for QQP in terms of F1-score."* The table compares the performance of three BERT-based model configurations—**BERT+CE**, **BERT+DL**, and **BERT+DSC**—on two datasets, **SST-2** and **SST-5**, measured by accuracy (Acc).  

- **Columns**:  
  - **Model**: Lists the three model configurations.  
  - **SST-2 Acc**: Displays accuracy scores for the SST-2 dataset.  
  - **SST-5 Acc**: Displays accuracy scores for the SST-5 dataset.  

- **Model Performance**:  
  1. **BERT+CE**:  
     - SST-2 Acc: **94.90** (highest)  
     - SST-5 Acc: **55.57** (highest)  
  2. **BERT+DL**:  
     - SST-2 Acc: **94.37** (lowest)  
     - SST-5 Acc: **54.63** (lowest)  
  3. **BERT+DSC**:  
     - SST-2 Acc: **94.84** (intermediate)  
     - SST-5 Acc: **55.19** (intermediate)  

- **Key Observations**:  
  - **BERT+CE** consistently performs the best across both datasets, while **BERT+DL** performs the worst. **BERT+DSC** shows intermediate results.  
  - Performance differences are relatively small for **SST-2**, where all models achieve high accuracy (&gt;94%).  
  - For **SST-5**, the differences are slightly more pronounced, though overall accuracy is lower compared to SST-2.  

The table is presented in a clean, minimalistic format with numerical values clearly aligned, focusing solely on comparative model performance without additional visual elements.</data>
