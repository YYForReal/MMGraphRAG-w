  <data key="d1">"The image is a table titled 'English CoNLL 2003' that presents the performance of various models on the CoNLL 2003 dataset, specifically focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER). The table includes three columns: 'Model', 'Prec.' (Precision), 'Rec.' (Recall), and 'F1' (F1 Score). The models listed are as follows:1. **ELMo (Peters et al., 2018)**: Precision and Recall are not reported, but the F1 score is 92.22.2. **CVT (Clark et al., 2018)**: Precision and Recall are not reported, but the F1 score is 92.6.3. **BERT-Tagger (Devlin et al., 2018)**: Precision and Recall are not reported, but the F1 score is 92.8.4. **BERT-MRC (Li et al., 2019)**: Precision is 92.33, Recall is 94.61, and the F1 score is 93.04.5. **BERT-MRC+FL**: Precision is 93.13, Recall is 93.09, and the F1 score is 93.11, which is an improvement of +0.06 over BERT-MRC.6. **BERT-MRC+DL**: Precision is 93.22, Recall is 93.12, and the F1 score is 93.17, which is an improvement of +0.12 over BERT-MRC.7. **BERT-MRC+DSC**: Precision is 93.41, Recall is 93.25, and the F1 score is 93.33, which is an improvement of +0.29 over BERT-MRC.The table highlights the performance of different models, with BERT-MRC serving as the baseline. Variants of BERT-MRC, such as those incorporating Focal Loss (FL), Dice Loss (DL), and DSC Loss, show incremental improvements in F1 scores. The DSC Loss variant achieves the highest F1 score of 93.33, outperforming the baseline by +0.29. The context provided indicates that the DSC Loss is particularly effective in addressing data imbalance issues, leading to significant performance gains compared to other loss functions like Focal Loss and Dice Loss."</data>
