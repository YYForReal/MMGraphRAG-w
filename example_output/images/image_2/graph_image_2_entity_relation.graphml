  <data key="d1">**IMAGE_2** is a line graph titled *"Figure 1: An illustration of derivatives of the four losses."* The graph plots the derivatives of four distinct loss functions against the probability of the ground-truth label, denoted as \( \bar{p}_i \). The x-axis represents \( \bar{p}_i \), ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents the derivatives, ranging from -2 to 2. Each loss function is depicted with a unique color and marker style:  

1. **FL (γ=1)** (blue line with triangle markers): The derivative starts at approximately -2 when \( \bar{p}_i = 0 \) and increases sharply as \( \bar{p}_i \) approaches 1, reaching 0 only when \( \bar{p}_i = 1 \).  
2. **DL (γ=1)** (orange line with triangle markers): The derivative begins at around -1 when \( \bar{p}_i = 0 \) and rises gradually, reaching 0 at \( \bar{p}_i = 1 \).  
3. **TL (β=0.5)** (yellow line with triangle markers): The derivative starts near -1.5 at \( \bar{p}_i = 0 \) and increases steadily, reaching 0 at \( \bar{p}_i = 1 \).  
4. **DSC** (purple line with triangle markers): The derivative begins at approximately -1 when \( \bar{p}_i = 0 \) and rises gradually. Unlike the others, DSC's derivative approaches zero as soon as \( \bar{p}_i \) exceeds 0.5, rather than waiting until \( \bar{p}_i = 1 \).  

**Key Observations:**  
- FL, DL, and TL derivatives reach zero only when \( \bar{p}_i = 1 \), indicating these losses push the probability toward 1.  
- DSC behaves differently, stabilizing near zero once \( \bar{p}_i &gt; 0.5 \), suggesting it is less sensitive to higher probabilities compared to the other losses.  
- The graph underscores the contrasting responses of these loss functions to changes in \( \bar{p}_i \), with DSC exhibiting a distinct pattern compared to FL, DL, and TL.  

The visualization effectively highlights the varying dynamics of these loss functions in relation to the ground-truth label probability.</data>
